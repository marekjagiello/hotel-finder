Implement
[NewestHotelStreetFinder](src/main/java/com/hrs/sourcing/coding_task/NewestHotelStreetFinder.java),
it should return option of address for the most recently (newest) build hotel.

After you are done with implementation put your class to test in
[NewestHotelStreetFinderTest](src/test/java/com/hrs/sourcing/coding_task/NewestHotelStreetFinderTest.java).
Basic tests are already in place all you have to do is to create new instance of your finder.
